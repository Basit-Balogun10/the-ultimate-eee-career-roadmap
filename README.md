# The Ultimate EEE Career Roadmap

A Guide to Navigating the Electrical & Electronics Engineering Degree from the Classroom to a Global Career.

---

## üìñ About This Project

This repository contains the source material for "The Ultimate EEE Career Roadmap," a comprehensive guide created for and by the students of the University of Lagos (UNILAG). The goal of this project is to provide a clear, actionable path for EEE and CPE students to build practical, industry-relevant skills and successfully launch their careers.

This is a living document, and this repository serves as the central hub for its evolution.

## üöÄ Motivation

This project was born from a pressing need many of us feel: a significant gap between our theoretical academic curriculum and the practical skills required to land internships and full-time roles in the global tech industry. This guide is our attempt to bridge that gap, cut through the academic noise, and provide a focused, project-based framework for building a powerful engineering portfolio, independent of CGPA.

The full backstory and vision for this project can be found in the preface of the document itself.

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Structured

The roadmap is divided into two main parts:

*   **Part I: The Actionable Career Guide:** A "top-down" view of 17 different career paths, complete with job descriptions, required skills, high-impact portfolio projects, target companies, and salary expectations.
*   **Part II: The Foundational Field Guide:** A "bottom-up" academic reference for over 30 foundational EEE subjects, providing recommended textbooks, online resources, and skill-building projects for each.
